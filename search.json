With this course I found it very easy to solve the problems. This course starts from the basics then build the full understanding of the subject. My dream to be in DSE was only possible because of this course. Apart from classes, sir was always available for solving any conceptual, nonconceptual doubts, giving suggestions and guidance. Thankyou sir for all your suggestions and guidance.\r\nUjjawal Parashar (Cleared DSE & IGIDR, 2020)\r\nThere were hardly two months left for the entrances and with no background in economics I picked one of the DSE’s past year question papers. Though I had gone through the standard micro economics books I was not able to solve more than 2-3 questions of the micro and none of the game theory. This was the time when I started searching for any online course/material that could help me and I came across this Micro + Game Theory course by Ravit Sir. The way this course was designed helped us gain in depth subject knowledge along with all the mathematical skills one needs for solving DSE level questions. Solving topic wise past year questions get us familiarized with the pattern and the level of the exam. From being able to solve hardly 2-3 questions to getting all my micro and game theory questions correct in the entrance, to getting offer letters from two of the premier institutes of economics in India to choosing IGIDR over DSE, here I am pursuing a masters in economics from IGIDR 2020-22 batch. The subject knowledge I gained in this course is now helping me survive these rigors times of masters. I would highly recommend this course to the students. It’s worth investing your time.\r\nAhmed Mustafa Barbhuiya (DSE, 2020)\r\nI wanted to prepare for DSE MA Economics course. While searching for suggestions, I reached Ravit Sir’s YouTube channel. And from there I got enrolled in his Micro and Game theory classes. His lectures were very helpful for me in solving entrance exam’s problems. I was not from Economics background but still managed to understand. I will, without any doubt, recommend his classes to anyone who wants to prepare for DSE & other M.A. Economics entrances. Even after the entrance, I faced issues in admission process and he helped me there too.\r\nAlam Seemon (MSE, 2020)\r\nMicroeconomics and Game theory by Ravit sir, has helped me a lot in my PG Economics entrance preparation in a very short period of 2 months. He puts sincere efforts to make sure the students got a clear understanding of the topics taught and started his teaching from the very basic concepts. He has covered all the major portions relevant to DSE and ISI entrances and given a better understanding of the subject. Since the class size were relatively small, there were lots of opportunity to clear the doubts during the class itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
